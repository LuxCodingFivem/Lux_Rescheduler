# Lux\_Rescheduler

Lux\_Rescheduler is a simple desktop tool for shifting all calendar events from one day to another in a CalDAV calendar.

## ‚ú® What it does

This tool connects to your CalDAV calendar and allows you to **shift all events from a given start date to a new target date**. It's ideal for people who use their calendar as a task or todo list and sometimes don‚Äôt get through all their tasks in one day. Instead of manually moving each event, this app automates the process with one click.

As someone who personally uses their CalDAV calendar as a todo list, I created this because I often had to move several events from one day to another manually ‚Äî this tool saves time and clicks.

## üñ• How to Use

You can run this application in two ways:

### 1. As a Python script

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then, install the required libraries:

```bash
pip install customtkinter tkcalendar caldav
```

Then run the script with:

```bash
python Lux_Rescheduler.py
```

### 2. As a standalone executable (Windows)

You can download the latest `.exe` release from the [Releases](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME/releases](https://github.com/LuxCodingFivem/Lux_Rescheduler/releases/tag/v1.0.0) section of this repository.
Just download and run ‚Äî no installation or Python setup required.

> The app stores your CalDAV credentials encrypted using Windows DPAPI in a local `settings.json` file.
